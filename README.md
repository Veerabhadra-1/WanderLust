# WanderLust
I am very excited to share that I’ve built my first full-stack project – a clone of the Airbnb website, which I’ve named Wanderlust 🌍✨
This project gave me hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development. From building a responsive UI to handling routing, maps, databases, and deployment — I learned a lot at every step! 💻🔧
🔹 Frontend Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
 🔹 Backend Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js
 🔹 Database: MongoDB
 🔹 Image Storage: Cloudinary
 🔹 Maps: Mapbox
 🔹 Deployment: Render
 🔹 UI: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
